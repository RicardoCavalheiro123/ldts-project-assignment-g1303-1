## LPOO_<T><G> - <PROJECT NAME>

> Our game consists in a Hero, known as, Bomberman who has the ability to drop BOMBS which are able to destroy some types of blocks and also to KILL the enemies, which is the main goal! By killing all the enemies you will then WIN the game!
This game was developed by *Diogo Babo* (up202004407@fe.up.pt), *João Oliveira* (*up202004407@fe.up.pt) and *Ricardo Cavalheiro* (up202004407@fe.up.pt) for LDTS 2021/2022.

### IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

- **Movement** - The game character (hero) will move depending on which arrow key is pressed.
- **Droping a Bomb** - The game character (hero) will drop a bomb where is he currently standing when the space bar is pressed. This bomb is able to destroy the non-concrete blocks but not the others.

### PLANNED FEATURES

- **Shop** - Will you will be able to buy new characters and maybe powerups (not defined yet).
- **Enemies** - There will be many enemies which move accordingly to the hero position.


### DESIGN

> This section should be organized in different subsections, each describing a different design problem that you had to solve during the project. Each subsection should be organized in four different parts:

- **Problem in Context.** The description of the design context and the concrete problem that motivated the instantiation of the pattern. Someone else other than the original developer should be able to read and understand all the motivations for the decisions made. When refering to the implementation before the pattern was applied, don’t forget to [link to the relevant lines of code](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet) in the appropriate version.
- **The Pattern.** Identify the design pattern to be applied, why it was selected and how it is a good fit considering the existing design context and the problem at hand.
- **Implementation.** Show how the pattern roles, operations and associations were mapped to the concrete design classes. Illustrate it with a UML class diagram, and refer to the corresponding source code with links to the relevant lines (these should be [relative links](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-readmes#relative-links-and-image-paths-in-readme-files). When doing this, always point to the latest version of the code.
- **Consequences.** Benefits and liabilities of the design after the pattern instantiation, eventually comparing these consequences with those of alternative solutions.

**Example of one of such subsections**:

#### Hero and Robot

**Problem in Context**

We have a Hero class and Robot class that have the same methods, such as moveUp, moveDown, moveLeft and move Right and the method draw which depends on the object.

**Factory Method**

We have applied the **Factory Method** pattern. 

**Implementation**

The following figure shows how the pattern’s roles were mapped to the application classes.

These classes can be found in the following files:

- [Character](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/Character.java)
- [JumpAbilityState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/JumpAbilityState.java)
- [DoubleJumpState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/DoubleJumpState.java)
- [HelicopterState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/HelicopterState.java)
- [IncreasedGravityState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/IncreasedGravityState.java)

**Consequences**

The use of the State Pattern in the current design allows the following benefits:

- The several states that represent the character’s hability to jump become explicit in the code, instead of relying on a series of flags.
- We don’t need to have a long set of conditional if or switch statements associated with the various states; instead, polimorphism is used to activate the right behavior.
- There are now more classes and instances to manage, but still in a reasonable number.

#### KNOWN CODE SMELLS AND REFACTORING SUGGESTIONS

> This section should describe 3 to 5 different code smells that you have identified in your current implementation, and suggest ways in which the code could be refactored to eliminate them. Each smell and refactoring suggestions should be described in its own subsection.

**Example of such a subsection**:

------

#### DATA CLASS

The `PlatformSegment` class is a **Data Class**, as it contains only fields, and no behavior. This is problematic because […].

A way to improve the code would be to move the `isPlatformSegmentSolid()` method to the `PlatformSegment` class, as this logic is purely concerned with the `PlatformSegment` class.

### TESTING

- Screenshot of coverage report.
- Link to mutation testing report.

### SELF-EVALUATION

> In this section describe how the work regarding the project was divided between the students. In the event that members of the group do not agree on a work distribution, the group should send an email to the teacher explaining the disagreement.

**Example**:

- John Doe: 40%
- Jane Doe: 60%
